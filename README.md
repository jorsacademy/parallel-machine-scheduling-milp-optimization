# Parallel Machine Scheduling with MILP Optimization

This project demonstrates a medium-level **identical parallel machine scheduling** problem solved with a **Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** model in Python.

The objective is to assign a set of independent jobs to identical parallel machines so that the **makespan** — the largest total workload assigned to any machine — is minimized.

The project includes a modular data layer, MILP model construction, independent solution validation, detailed schedule reporting, and automatic Gantt chart generation.

## Problem Description

The sample instance contains:

- 12 independent jobs
- 3 identical parallel machines
- Deterministic processing times
- No preemption
- No release dates
- No precedence constraints
- No sequence-dependent setup times

Each job must be assigned to exactly one machine. Since machines are identical and there are no sequence-dependent effects, the order of jobs on an individual machine does not influence the objective value. The MILP therefore optimizes the assignment decisions directly.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Sets

- `J`: set of jobs
- `M`: set of identical machines

### Parameter

- `p_j`: processing time of job `j`

### Decision Variable

- `x_jm = 1` if job `j` is assigned to machine `m`; `0` otherwise

### Makespan Variable

- `C_max`: maximum workload among all machines

### Objective Function

Minimize:

```text
C_max
```

### Constraints

Each job must be assigned exactly once:

```text
sum_m x_jm = 1    for every job j
```

The workload of each machine cannot exceed the makespan:

```text
sum_j p_j * x_jm <= C_max    for every machine m
```

Binary restriction:

```text
x_jm in {0, 1}
```

## Sample Data

| Job | Processing Time |
|---|---:|
| J1 | 14 |
| J2 | 9 |
| J3 | 18 |
| J4 | 7 |
| J5 | 13 |
| J6 | 6 |
| J7 | 11 |
| J8 | 16 |
| J9 | 8 |
| J10 | 10 |
| J11 | 15 |
| J12 | 5 |

The total processing time is 132 time units. With three machines, the average-load lower bound is:

```text
ceil(132 / 3) = 44
```

The longest job requires 18 time units. Therefore, the standard lower bound is:

```text
max(44, 18) = 44
```

If the solver finds a feasible solution with makespan 44, that solution is proven optimal because it reaches the theoretical lower bound.

## Solution Validation

The project does not rely only on the solver status. After optimization, it independently verifies that:

1. Every expected job appears in the schedule.
2. No job is assigned more than once.
3. No unknown job appears in the solution.
4. The reconstructed machine workloads match the optimized makespan.
5. The makespan is not below a valid theoretical lower bound.

A successful run prints:

```text
Independent solution validation: PASSED
```

## Result Reporting

The program prints:

- Input processing-time table
- CBC solver status
- Theoretical lower bound
- Optimal makespan
- Gap between the lower bound and optimized makespan
- Machine-level job assignments
- Machine workloads
- Start, duration, and completion time for every scheduled job

The within-machine order is generated deterministically for reporting and visualization. It does not change the objective value for this specific scheduling model.

## Gantt Chart

After solving the MILP, the program automatically creates a Gantt chart with Matplotlib.

The generated file is saved as:

```text
outputs/gantt_chart.png
```

Each bar represents a scheduled job. The horizontal position indicates the job's start and completion times, while each row represents one machine.

The `outputs/` directory is excluded from Git because it contains generated results.

## Why This Formulation Is Correct

A common modeling error in parallel-machine scheduling is to introduce completion-time variables indexed by sequence positions without defining a valid sequencing structure. In that case, the sequence index does not represent a real schedule.

For the problem considered in this repository, completion-time or sequence-position decision variables are unnecessary. There are no release dates, precedence constraints, setup times, or other sequence-dependent effects. Therefore, minimizing the maximum total processing load assigned to any identical machine is equivalent to minimizing the makespan.

This produces a compact and mathematically valid MILP formulation.

## Possible Extensions

The current model is intentionally medium-level and can be extended to include:

- Unrelated or uniform parallel machines
- Machine-dependent processing times
- Release dates
- Job priorities or weights
- Due dates and tardiness penalties
- Machine eligibility restrictions
- Sequence-dependent setup times
- Precedence constraints
- Multiple optimization objectives

These extensions require additional decision variables and constraints because sequencing may then affect feasibility or the objective value.
